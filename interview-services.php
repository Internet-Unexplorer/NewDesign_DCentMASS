<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-6">As business begins to pick up and your company is ready to grow again, your volume of requests for new hires can skyrocket. Most HR departments simply don't have enough bandwidth to cover all of their company's recruiting needs in this situation. Hudson RPO is ready to step into your existing structure to augment the recruitment process throughout the entire enterprise or wherever you need us. Using recruitment process outsourcing for a department where you have the heaviest need, such as Sales or R&D, can lower your cost and reduce time-to-fill while providing consistency and uniformity within the workforce. Hudson RPO can also manage all the sourcing, screening, and measurement tactics for your entire organization, while your existing HR team handles the interviewing, hiring and on boarding processes. Choosing which portions of the recruitment process you want to outsource, provides the flexibility to decide what is best for your business.</div>
